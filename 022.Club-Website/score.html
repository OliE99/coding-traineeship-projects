                    <h2>Recent Matches & Scores</h2>
                    <h3>Norton vs Sedgefield U15's County Age Group (Northern Cup)</h3>
                    <h4>Our U15’s CAG side travelled away to Norton to continue their ECB County Cup campaign at Ottery St Mary CC. The home side won the toss and elected to bat first in the depths of the North East.</h4>
                    <p>Proceedings got off to a great start for Sedgefield as Ben Rivers (1 for 5) and Oliver Pearson (2 for 19) both made initial breakthroughs to leave Norton reeling at 25 for 3. Number 3 Norton batsman Finley Hill (40 off 71) played the anchor role as he held the home sides innings together. However, Lysander Tarrant (4 for 28) kept taking wickets at regular wickets as Norton’s middle to late order couldn’t get going as they were eventually all out for 140 inside 42 overs. <br>

                        In reply, Sedgefield couldn’t quite get off to the start they would have hoped as Finley Hill bowled with great pace and accuracy to restrict our top order. Skipper Max Dunne (37 off 57) and James Austen (31 off 53) had a valuable partnership of 63 which saw them take the total to 123 for 6. With Finley Hill (6 for 23) still chipping away, this meant William Merrett and Jacob Stevenson batted with calm heads to see Sedgefield over the line at 144 for 9 in 37.5 overs for a 1 wicket win.<br>
                        
                        Thanks to Norton for a brilliant fixture which was closely competitive throughout and for Ottery St Mary CC for hosting us.</p><br>
                    <h3>Sedgefield U12's County Age Group vs Oxfordshire (Friendly)</h3>
                    <h4>An emphatic victory for our U12s CAG side, saw an 105 run win against Oxfordshire at Lydney CC. Sedgefield won the toss and skipper Joseph Armitage elected to bat first.</h4>
                    <p>Arthur Sweeting at the top of the order built a solid platform for the home side as he hit 33 off 79 balls. This set up wicket keeper (and brother!) Will Sweeting to smash a brilliant 51 off 36 balls to help rally Sedgefield to 140 for 8. Oxfordshire bowled with great control to our middle order and make sure the home side didn’t kick on any further.<br>

                        In reply, Sedgefield opening bowlers Jack Baker and Shriranj Praveen bowled remarkably in partnership to take 9 wickets between them. Baker bowling 5 overs, taking 4 wickets for 5 runs and Praveen bowling 7.3 overs taking 5 wickets for 11 runs – a phenomenal effort as Oxforshire were all out for 39. A special mention to Oxfordshire batsman Patrick Smith who showed real resistance hitting 13 not out off 52 balls.<br>
                        
                        Thank you to our host ground Lydney CC for being brilliant hosts throughout the day and to the umpires for officiating.</p>
